# Detailled Engine Features

This document outlines all the features of the workflow engine project, including the use of attributes for defining dependencies, automatic context updates, and execution sequencing.

## Core Features

### 1. **Workflow Definition**
- Define workflows programmatically by adding individual steps.
- Support for dynamic and extensible step definitions.
- Steps are described using metadata attributes for clear dependency management.

### 2. **Dependency Management**
- Automatically resolve input and output dependencies between steps.
- Ensure correct sequencing of steps based on data flow (using a topological sort).
- Detect and handle missing inputs or circular dependencies.

### 3. **Step Metadata via Attributes**
- **InputAttribute**: Specifies required input parameters for a step.
- **OutputAttribute**: Specifies the output parameters produced by a step.
- Reflection-based extraction of metadata to automate dependency resolution.

### 4. **Execution Context Management**
- Centralized context to store and manage all data during workflow execution.
- Automatic injection of input values from the context into steps before execution.
- Automatic storage of output values back into the context after execution.

### 5. **Extensibility and Modularity**
- Easily add new steps by implementing the `IWorkflowStep` interface.
- Steps are self-contained and reusable, promoting modular design.
- Support for custom parameter injection and processing logic.

### 6. **Error Handling**
- Detect and throw exceptions for missing inputs during step execution.
- Validate data types and enforce constraints during runtime.
- Provide detailed error messages for easier debugging and troubleshooting.

### 7. **Execution Sequencing**
- Use dependency metadata to calculate the execution order.
- Support for complex workflows with multiple branches and convergences.
- Ensure that steps execute only when all their dependencies are satisfied.

### 8. **Serialization and Persistence**
- Save workflows as JSON for storage and reuse.
- Deserialize JSON to recreate workflows dynamically.
- Include step metadata (inputs, outputs, parameters) in the JSON representation.

### 9. **Dynamic Parameter Management**
- Steps can declare and manage their own parameters.
- Parameters are injected dynamically based on context and metadata.
- Support for optional and default parameters.

### 10. **Logging and Monitoring**
- Log execution details for each step (start, end, errors).
- Track the state of the context at each step for debugging.
- Provide execution summaries upon workflow completion.

## Example Use Cases

### Example 1: Simple Linear Workflow
**Steps**:
1. Generate a value (`StepA`).
2. Transform the value (`StepB`).
3. Display the result (`StepC`).

**Features Used**:
- Dependency management via attributes.
- Automatic context updates.
- Execution sequencing.

### Example 2: Branching Workflow
**Steps**:
1. Generate multiple values.
2. Run independent transformations on each value.
3. Combine results into a final step.

**Features Used**:
- Dependency resolution for branching paths.
- Modular step definitions.
- Dynamic context updates.

## Technical Components

### Key Interfaces and Classes
- **`IWorkflowStep`**: Interface for defining steps with inputs, outputs, and execution logic.
- **`WorkflowContext`**: Centralized store for data shared between steps.
- **`Workflow`**: Core engine for managing and executing steps in the correct order.
- **`StepMetadataHelper`**: Utility for extracting input and output metadata using Reflection.

### Metadata Attributes
- **`InputAttribute`**: Declares required inputs for a step.
- **`OutputAttribute`**: Declares outputs produced by a step.

## Advantages of This Design
- **Automation**: Automatically manages dependencies and context updates.
- **Flexibility**: Easily adapt to new requirements with modular step design.
- **Scalability**: Handles complex workflows with many steps and dependencies.
- **Readability**: Metadata attributes provide clear, declarative descriptions of step dependencies.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Graphical Workflow Designer**
   - Build workflows visually with drag-and-drop steps.
   - Export/import workflows as JSON.

2. **Parallel Execution**
   - Support for executing independent steps in parallel.
   - Optimize workflows for faster execution.

3. **Advanced Error Recovery**
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed steps.
   - Add support for compensating transactions.

4. **Versioning and Auditing**
   - Track changes to workflows over time.
   - Provide detailed audit logs for executed workflows.

5. **Integration with External Systems**
   - Add connectors for APIs, databases, and message queues.
   - Enable seamless integration with external tools and services.
